# Matrix Solver
I like linear algebra so here we are. Starting with the method or row reducing that I learned in class then looking into other methods of solving.

Probably done with this for a while, I learned all I wanted to from it for now.

### TODO:
- Comment the algorithms...
- Test the algorithms with more matrices
