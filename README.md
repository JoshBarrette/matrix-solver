# Matrix Solver
I like linear algebra so here we are. Starting with the method or row reducing that I learned in class then looking into other methods of solving.

### TODO:
- Add matrix and row objects to make operations easier.
- Really need to add a way to get inputs from files instead of hardcoding. CSVs would be cool.
